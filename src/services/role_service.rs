// ROLE MANAGEMENT LOGIC GOES HERE
// Possible permissions: Read, Write, Delete, Admin
// Admin could add other roles and assign permissions
// Write could only modify content within their own tables
// Read could only view content
// Delete could remove content but not modify structure
// Each role should have specific permissions associated with it
// Users can not be assigned multiple roles
